# Download Rocket Widget

Small demo of a download animation using React + Three.js (react-three-fiber).

To run:

1. cd download-rocket-widget
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

This is a small standalone demo intended to be integrated into your existing site. You can provide either:

- A glTF model (recommended): place a file named `rocket.glb` in `download-rocket-widget/public/` and the demo will load it automatically.
- Or an SVG sprite: place `rocket.svg` in `download-rocket-widget/public/` and the demo will use it as a crisp 2D sprite. If neither are present the demo falls back to a rocket emoji.
 - A glTF model (recommended): place a file named `rocket.glb` or `rocket.gltf` in `download-rocket-widget/public/` and the demo will load it automatically. A tiny sample `rocket.gltf` is included.
 - Or an SVG sprite: place `rocket.svg` in `download-rocket-widget/public/` and the demo will use it as a crisp 2D sprite. If neither are present the demo falls back to a rocket emoji.

Ask me to adapt the widget into your current codebase and I will provide a focused integration plan.
