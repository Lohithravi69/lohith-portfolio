// overflow-fix.js — REMOVED
// This file previously contained an overflow scanner used for debugging layout issues.
// Per project cleanup, the runtime behavior has been removed and this file now serves
// as a marker. Remove this file entirely if you want it deleted from the repository.

// (no-op placeholder removed runtime code)
